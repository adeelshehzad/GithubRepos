# GithubRepos
Android application that displays Kotlin language repositories 

Developed by integrating Android jetpack components such as <b>Navigation</b> and <b>Data Binding</b><br>
Uses <b>MVVM</b> architecture pattern with <b>RxJava/RxAndroid</b> implementation

# RoadMap
1) Add feature to search for different language repositories
2) Add user github login 
3) Display logged in user's github repo
4) Allow users to manage their own repositories
